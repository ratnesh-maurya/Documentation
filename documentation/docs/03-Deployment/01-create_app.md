**2.** Name your application, select workspace and choose your codebase. (Current options only include GitHub)

**3.** To link your codebase, you’ll need to install initializ on your GitHub. Seems hard?
No, it’s not. Just **Click! Click! Click!**

       a. Click on the “edit your Github permissions” link

      c. Grant access to repositories as per your choice. Don’t worry, it’s completely safe.

      d. Authorize initializ with GitHub.

After this you’ll be redirected back to initializ.ai where you can select a repository for your application.

**4.** Select repository, branch and subfolder for your app deployment.

**Tip**💡
**_You can also enable vertical auto-scaling. Vertical Auto-Scaling allows the App to use resources beyond the request when needed._**

- ## Review

Once you have selected codebase and resources, you can Review and Deploy your App. If you feel like editing something, just hit BACK.
